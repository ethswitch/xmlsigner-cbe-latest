o import an RSA private key and its corresponding public certificate into a PKCS#12 keystore using OpenSSL, follow these steps:

Prepare Your Files:

Private Key: Ensure you have your RSA private key file, e.g., private_key.pem.

Public Certificate: Ensure you have your public certificate file, e.g., public_certificate.pem.

Combine the Private Key and Certificate:

Use OpenSSL to create a PKCS#12 keystore (keystore.p12) that contains both the private key and the public certificate:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
openssl pkcs12 -export -out C:/etswitch/national_payment_gateway/certs/keys/participants/wegagen/keystore.p12 -inkey C:/Users/wegderestsige/Documents/IPS/Cert/JWT_Private.key -in C:/Users/wegderestsige/Documents/IPS/Cert/certnew.cer -name "CBETETAA"

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


-export specifies that a PKCS#12 file is being created.​

-out keystore.p12 names the output file.​

-inkey private_key.pem specifies the private key file.​
Stack Overflow

-in public_certificate.pem specifies the public certificate file.​


-name "my_alias" assigns an alias to the key pair in the keystore.​

You will be prompted to set an export password to protect the keystore.

Verify the PKCS#12 Keystore (Optional):

To inspect the contents of the created keystore.p12 file:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
openssl pkcs12 -info -in keystore.p12

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



This command will display information about the keystore's contents.

Note: If you have an existing certificate chain (e.g., intermediate and root certificates), you can include them in the PKCS#12 file by appending them to the public_certificate.pem file or specifying them with the -certfile option. This ensures the entire chain is included in the keystore.​

By following these steps, you can successfully import your RSA private key and public certificate into a PKCS#12 keystore using OpenSSL
